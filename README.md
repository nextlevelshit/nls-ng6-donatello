| `npm run start`  | start development server on `http://localhost:4200/`            |
| `npm run build`  | build production application and save to `./dist`               |

## Development server

Download dependencies with `npm i` or `yarn`.

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Browser opens and navigates automatically to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
